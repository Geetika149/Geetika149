## Skills
- **Languages:** Python &#xf3e2;, C &#xf1c9;
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** matplotlib &#xf200;
- **Tools:** VSCode &#xf3ed;, MATLAB &#xf11b;

## Projects
Here are a few projects I've worked on:

1. **3D Printed Polymer Analysis for Structural Beams** - Evaluated PEKK, Nylon PA 12, and CFRP for beam fabrication, using Fusion 360 simulations to assess mechanical properties and load behavior. The findings guide material selection for additive manufacturing in structural applications.
2. **Analysis of Double Pipe Parallel Flow Heat Exchanger with U Bend** - Modeled and meshed a double pipe heat exchanger with a U-bend. Applied boundary conditions and selected turbulence models for solving fluid flow and heat transfer simulations. Post-processed results to analyze temperature distribution, pressure drop, and overall heat transfer efficiency for design optimization.
3. **CFD Analysis of Two-Phase Core Annular Flow in Crude Oil Transport Pipeline** - Conducted a detailed CFD analysis of two-phase core annular flow in a crude oil transport pipeline. Modeled the pipeline geometry and generated precise meshes to capture phase interfaces. Implemented suitable multiphase models and boundary conditions, then post-processed results to analyze flow characteristics, pressure distribution, and phase behavior, optimizing efficiency and reliability of crude oil transport.
4. **Analysis of Melting & Solidification of Phase Change Material** - Analyzed the melting and solidification processes of phase change materials (PCM) using ANSYS Fluent. Created and meshed PCM containment geometry, applied thermal models and boundary conditions, and post-processed results to evaluate temperature distribution, phase interface movement, and thermal performance, providing insights for optimizing PCM applications in thermal energy storage systems.
